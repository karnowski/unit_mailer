- Change to work at your individual mailer's level, not the entire "ActionMailer::Base" level.
  - Update the README when this change is made.
- Add actual tests.
- Change to use modules and elegantly include them into ActionMailer::Base and ActionMailer::TestCase
  rather than brutally duck-punching them.
- Choose a better signature for seeing what was rendered, similar to UnitController's assert_rendered,
  and then add this to ActionMailer::TestCase rather than living in ActionMailer::Base.
- Add a way to determine what MIME type(s) were rendered.  (For example, HTML, text/plain, etc.)
